The following data files and all data files used to generate these files contain 33 features--no entropy, and no VIG_deg_std (which is an accident).

The following data files contains the same features as the files above. However, they should be trained with dimension-unrelated features (15), which is a subset of the features above. On the other hand, the occurrence of formulae with a certain num_var is the same for SAT examples and UNSAT examples.
